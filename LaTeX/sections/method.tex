\section{Method}
\label{section:method}
%In this section, the method used to find an answer to the research questions should be presented. 

%If this report presents results from a literature search, this means providing sufficient information 
%for allowing someone else to repeat the literature search and compare the results. I.e., a search using 
%the phrases a, b, and c, was made in database x, y and z on the date Month Date, Year (e.g., July 31st, 
%2021). The search resulted in x hits. Then, information on how you chose which works to include in this 
%report should be provided. The references should be used for answering your research questions.

%If the work reports on an experiment, this part should provide information about the experimental setup, 
%how the experiment was conducted, how data was collected and analyzed etc. Motivate methodological choices 
%through references. Also an experiment should be presented with sufficient detail such that it can be 
%repeated by someone else.



Done so far: 

\begin{itemize}
    
    \item Made a new fixture for the arm to allow easier access to it in exchange for disconnecting the shoulder motor for now.
    
    \item Used the Myoware 1.0 to sample a signal and tried to do the same with Myoware 2.0.
    
    \item Installed the needed software for the roboRIO to work and started investigating the use of LabView in tandem with it.
    
\end{itemize}
Need to do:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Either acquire a second Myoware 1.0 or get the Myoware 2.0 to work.
    
    \item Set ut a shared database and data sampling method.
    
    \item Start sampling
    
    \item Choose AI method
    
    \item Either find a prebuilt or build an AI
\end{itemize}
