\section{Conclusion}
\blindtext

The training of the RNN was not able to be completed.
Due to unnoticed bugs the training that had been done was found to be invalid and could not be rectified in time.
The
weights of the RNN could not be transferred to LabView without great difficulties due to the lack of clarity provided by
pyTorch.
Making use of methods that would allow for either easier weight extraction or for the model to be trained
directly in LabView would be preferred.


The method for driving the actuators at variable speeds was not implemented
Due to time constraints the method for driving them at variable speeds was not implemented.


The time it takes to run one iteration of the code in LabView was INSERT TIME.
A definite improvement from the starting point of the previous work, showing an improvement by ???\%. (MIGHT WANT TO TRY TO MEASURE THE TIME A BIT MORE
PROPERLY FROM THE VIDEO)
