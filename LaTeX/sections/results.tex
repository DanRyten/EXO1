\section{Results}
\label{section:results}

%This section should present answers to all research questions.
%
%It is normal to have only one results section, but you can create more sections if finding it more appropriate. You can
%also divide results into subsections. Perhaps you want to refer to some other section, for example (see Section \ref{section:method}).
%You can also place figures, you should always reference these in the text, see Figure \ref{fig:MDHlogga} for an example of a figure
%including subfigures. Remember that all figures should have a figure label explaining their content.

The \acrshort{rnn} in Python was not able to output the three distinct states of 
function for the arm since both \acrshort{rnn} models achieved a precision of 25\% on the validation set no matter the
learning rate or number of epochs used. Additionally, the results consisted of the model only giving one single class as the output
and therefore having a 100\% accuracy on that specific class and a 0\% accuracy on the rest of the classes. 
This led to the model's weights never being transferred to LabView.
%the time it takes to run one iteration of the code in LabView was 230ms.
