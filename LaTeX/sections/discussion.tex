Regarding \textbf{RQ3}, during testing of the exoskeleton made by the last group, the exoskeleton finished a full movement from start to stop approximately 
one second after the user finished the movement based on observation of a video from the previous group. During testing of the RNN 
code in Labview a full iteration took 230 ms, showing a clear improvement.
