Physically demanding work often results in strain-related health issues, impairing individuals' ability to perform daily tasks and potentially causing long-term disability due to their long working hours. 
Exoskeletons offer a solution that can relieve the workers from some of the load during the workdays, but exoskeletons do not come cheap, their high cost and person-specific designs limit their availability. 
This project aims to explore the viability of future works to develop a commercially viable powered exoskeleton to assist with arm movements, limited to elbow movements. 
The research addresses three primary questions: achieving three distinct elbow actuator states (upward, downward, rest), enabling variable speed depending on the user effort, and reducing response latency between the user's actions and the actuator. 
The research involved using two sEMG sensors and a LSTM RNN for signal classification implemented for the RoboRIO platform. 
While achieving partial success in the RoboRIO implementation, adequate weights and biases for the used data were not obtained. 
The project identified key areas for future improvement, including better data handling and functioning system communication.
