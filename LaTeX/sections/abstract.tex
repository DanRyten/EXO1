This project deals with creating a controll system for an exoskeleton using \acrshort{semg} processed by a \acrshort{rnn} in LabView
allowing for assistance during static work.
Though the training of the \acrshort{rnn} was incomplete, the speed of it shows definite improvement and the necessary structure
for a functioning controll unit is precent.
