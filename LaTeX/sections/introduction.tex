THESE ARE NEEDED FOR NOW. REMOVE LATER!!!! \cite{workdemands}".

Agriculture leaves many people with such severe strain that they cannot continue working in their field. The same can be said 
for both assembly and healthcare where many assembly workers and nurses have their careers limited by excesssive strain. The 
burdens they are placed under can be allivated using exoskeletons but they are often prohibitively expensive both from a 
matriell cost and since most are person specific. The majority of comercially available exoskeleton are passive providing no 
extra power of their own but simply redestributing the load instead. The goal of this project is to advance the possibility of 
comercially viable exoskeletons that can assist workers in these fields.

Introduction:
    Introduce the reader:
        What are exoskeletons?
        What is EMG?

    Motivation:
        Static struggles!
            Medical work:
                Assitance while having to hold patients in exact positions for long durations during surgeries

            Industrial work:
                Assitance while working in awkward positions like overhead or under the hood of a car for example

            Agricultural work:
                Assitance while working overhead to pick for example mangos
            
            All above:
                Helps while carrying stuff

    Describe the subject:
        Idk, stuff?

    Aim of the thesis work:
        Problem formulation: %This sounds a lot like aim of the thesis work so I added it here
            Research questions:
                1.	Can the exoskeleton be driven based off of both the bicep and triceps? (So that it can be put at rest at a specified position)

                2.	Can the exoskeleton be made to drive at variable speeds?

                3.	Can the exoskeleton be made wearable?

            Problem:
                

            Scope:
            
            Relevance: %this is mostly motivation I guess
