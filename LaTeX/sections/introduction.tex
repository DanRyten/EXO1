THESE ARE NEEDED FOR NOW. REMOVE LATER!!!! \cite{workdemands}".

Agriculture leaves many people with such severe strain that they cannot continue working in their field. The same can be said 
for both assembly and healthcare where many assembly workers and nurses have their careers limited by excesssive strain. The 
burdens they are placed under can be allivated using exoskeletons but they are often prohibitively expensive both from a 
matriell cost and since most are person specific. The majority of comercially available exoskeleton are passive providing no 
extra power of their own but simply redestributing the load instead. The goal of this project is to advance the possibility of 
comercially viable exoskeletons that can assist workers in these fields by aiding them in bending and extending their arms as 
well as holding them in place.

Introduction:
    Introduce the reader:
        What are exoskeletons?
        What is EMG?

    Motivation:
        Static struggles!
            Medical work:
                Assitance while having to hold patients in exact positions for long durations during surgeries

            Industrial work:
                Assitance while working in awkward positions like overhead or under the hood of a car for example

            Agricultural work:
                Assitance while working overhead to pick for example mangos
            
            All above:
                Helps while carrying stuff

    Describe the subject:
        Idk, stuff?

    Aim of the thesis work:
        Problem formulation: %This sounds a lot like aim of the thesis work so I added it here
            Research questions:
                1.	Can the exoskeleton be driven based off of both the bicep and triceps? (So that it can be put at rest at a specified position)

                2.	Can the exoskeleton be made to drive at variable speeds?

                3.	Can the exoskeleton be made wearable?

            Problem:
                

            Scope:
            
            Relevance: %this is mostly motivation I guess

    Short background on the research field:

    Related work: %Probably more could be written about what it achied. Rn it feels harsher than it should be
        This project is based on the work of \cite{afes}, which achieved a working exoskeleton that could be driven by the bicep. However, the resulting 
        exoskeleton presented some limitations. The exoskeleton was mounted on a stand, rendering it therefore unwearable. Another significant limitation 
        that the exoskeleton exhibits lays in the fact that it can only be driven by the bicep. As such, the exoskeleton can only show three different states, 
        with them being fully extended, fully contracted, and at rest. One key issue that made the exoskeleton a valuable proof of concept, but not a viable 
        product consists on the limitations of the hardware and software used. The \acs{emg} sensor used employed an outdated Bluetooth module and the software was 
        written in Python, which due to its performance is not suitable for real-time applications in such a limited hardware.
