Here are a new paragraph and some examples of references and an abbreviation \cite{IEEEtran, IEEEtranformatexample, webpage, FundConDep, exampleofjournalarticle, exampleofconferencepaper}
\ac{svm}. When citing works, never start a sentence with a number. In such situations, write, e.g., "Liang et al. \cite{exampleofconferencepaper}" instead.


Research questions:

Can we make it attached to arm?

Can we make it run with less lagg?

Can we go both backwards, forwards and rest?

Can we make it go at variable speeds?
