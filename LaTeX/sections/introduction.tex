Research questions:

%Can we make it attached to arm?
%
%Can we make it run with less lagg?
%
%Can we go both backwards, forwards and rest?
%
%Can we make it go at variable speeds?

1.	Can the exoskeleton be driven based off of both the bicep and triceps? (So that it can be put at rest at a specified position)

2.	Can the exoskeleton be made wearable?

3.	Can the exoskeleton be made to drive at variable speeds?
