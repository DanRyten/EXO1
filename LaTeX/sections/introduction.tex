\section{Introduction}
\label{section:intro}

Physically demanding work can leave people with such severe strain that they have to work less or stop working entirely in 
their field\cite{WorkDemands}. The burdens they are placed under can be alleviated using exoskeletons but they are often 
prohibitively expensive both from a material cost and since most are person-specific. The majority of commercially available 
exoskeletons are passive providing no extra power of their own but simply redistributing the load instead. The goal of this 
project is to advance the possibility of commercially viable exoskeletons that can assist workers in these fields by aiding 
them in bending and extending their arms as well as holding them in place.

        Static struggles!
            Medical work:
                Assistance while having to hold patients in exact positions for long durations during surgeries

            Industrial work:
                Assistance while working in awkward positions like overhead or under the hood of a car for example

            Agricultural work:
                Assistance while working overhead to pick for example mangos

        Problem formulation: %This sounds a lot like aim of the thesis work so I added it here
            Research questions:
            \begin{itemize}
                 
                \item RQ1: Can the elbow actuator be given three distinct states of function, turning the arm upwards, downwards, and keeping it at rest?

                \item RQ2: Can the elbow actuator drive at variable speeds related to the effort expended by the wearer?

                \item RQ3: Can the latency of the actuator acting be reduced?

            \end{itemize}

            Problem:
                

            Limitations:
                This project was subject to several restraints from the beginning. The overarching one was the limited time of 8 weeks which was
                exasperated by the need to procure sensors, DAQ systems and applicable software. This factor mainly delayed the data acquisition. 
                Although the exoskeleton was assembled with degrees of freedom only the elbow joint was used. This was due to the larger complexity 
                of a shoulder movement requiring additional sensors and a larger system on all fronts.
            
            Relevance: %this is mostly motivation I guess

    Related work: %Probably more could be written about what it achied. Rn it feels harsher than it should be
        This project is based on the work of \cite{AFES}, which achieved a working exoskeleton that could be driven by the bicep. However, the resulting 
        exoskeleton presented some limitations. The exoskeleton was mounted on a stand, rendering it therefore unwearable. Another significant limitation 
        that the exoskeleton exhibits lies in the fact that it can only be driven by the bicep. As such, the exoskeleton can only show three different states, 
        with them being fully extended, fully contracted, and at rest. One key issue that made the exoskeleton a valuable proof of concept, but not a viable 
        product consists on the limitations of the hardware and software used. The \acs{emg} sensor used employed an outdated Bluetooth module and the software was 
        written in Python, which due to its performance is not suitable for real-time applications in such a limited hardware.
