	abstract = {Human intention has long been a primary emphasis in the field of electromyography (EMG) research. This being considered, the movement of the exoskeleton hand can be accurately predicted based on the user's preferences. The EMG is a nonlinear signal formed by muscle contractions as the human hand moves and easily captured noise signal from its surroundings. Due to this fact, this study aims to estimate wrist desired velocity based on EMG signals using ANN and FL mapping methods. The output was derived using EMG signals and wrist position were directly proportional to control wrist desired velocity. Ten male subjects, ranging in age from 21 to 40, supplied EMG signal data set used for estimating the output in single and double muscles experiments. To validate the performance, a physical model of an exoskeleton hand was created using Sim-mechanics program tool. The ANN used Levenberg training method with 1 hidden layer and 10 neurons, while FL used a triangular membership function to represent muscles contraction signals amplitude at different MVC levels for each wrist position. As a result, PID was substituted to compensate fluctuation of mapping outputs, resulting in a smoother signal reading while improving the estimation of wrist desired velocity performance. As a conclusion, ANN compensates for complex nonlinear input to estimate output, but it works best with large data sets. FL allowed designers to design rules based on their knowledge, but the system will struggle due to the large number of inputs. Based on the results achieved, FL was able to show a distinct separation of wrist desired velocity hand movement when compared to ANN for similar testing datasets due to the decision making based on rules setting setup by the designer.},
