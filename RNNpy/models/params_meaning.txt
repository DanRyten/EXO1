input and output layers weights:
    - Each chunk of size = input corresponds to the weights of each neuron

LSTM1 ih weights
    - Split into 60(4*15) chunks of 250
    - 250 weights for 4 gates for 15 nodes
LSTM1 hh weights
    - Split into 60(4*15) chunks of 15
    - 15 weights? for 4 gates for 15 nodes

LSTM2 ih weights
    - Split into 32(4*8) chunks of 15
    - 15 weights for 4 gates for 8 nodes
LSTM2 hh weights
    - Split into 32(4*8) chunks of 8
    - 8 weights? for 4 gates for 8 nodes
